## What You're Seeing

The artwork uses Total Serialism's algorithmic composition techniques:

- **Flow Fields**: Created using multiple sine/cosine waves (like synthesizer oscillators)
- **Particle Movement**: Follows euclidean rhythms (mathematical patterns found in world music)
- **Colors**: Based on musical chord progressions (I-vi-IV-V)
- **Distribution**: Uses Fibonacci sequences and golden ratio spirals
- **Texture**: Generated with cellular automaton patterns

Each refresh creates a completely unique piece!
